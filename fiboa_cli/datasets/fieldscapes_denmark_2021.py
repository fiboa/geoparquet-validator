DESCRIPTION = """Danish Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data collection or (field blocks/ 'Markblokke') is managed by The Danish Agency for Agriculture.

The field block map is a digital field map, with agricultural areas gathered in field blocks. A field block is a geographically coherent unit consisting of agricultural land. The boundaries of the field blocks typically follow permanent divisions in the landscape. The map is used in the administration of cases linked to the geographical determination of cultivation areas, primarily by the EU's area-based support schemes. The field block map is continuously updated on the basis of orthophotos and reports from farmers and authorities. The field block map covers approx. 2.8 million hectares of agricultural land. Each field block is identified with a field block number, area, type. A field block means a continuous area on which one or more farmers grow one or more different crops. The map is updated every night with changes from case processing."""

    Converts the field boundary datasets to fiboa.

    For reference, this is the order in which the conversion steps are applied:
    0. Read GeoDataFrame from file(s) and run the FILE_MIGRATION function if provided
    1. Run global migration (if provided through MIGRATION)
    2. Run filters to remove rows that shall not be in the final data
       (if provided through COLUMN_FILTERS)
    3. Add columns with constant values
    4. Run column migrations (if provided through COLUMN_MIGRATIONS)
    5. Duplicate columns (if an array is provided as the value in COLUMNS)
    6. Rename columns (as provided in COLUMNS)
    7. Remove columns (if column is not present as value in COLUMNS)
    8. Create the collection
    9. Change data types of the columns based on the provided schemas
    (fiboa spec, extensions, and MISSING_SCHEMAS)
    10. Write the data to the Parquet file

    Parameters:
    output_file (str): Path where the Parquet file shall be stored.
    cache (str): Path to a cached folder for the data. Default: None.
                      Can be used to avoid repetitive downloads from the original data source.
    source_coop_url (str): URL to the (future) Source Cooperative repository. Default: None
    collection (bool): Additionally, store the collection separate from Parquet file. Default: False
    compression (str): Compression method for the Parquet file. Default: zstd
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for GeoPanda's read_file() or read_parquet() function.
