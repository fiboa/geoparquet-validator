DESCRIPTION = """Sweden's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data collection (also agricultural blocks/ 'jordbruksblock') is managed by the Swedish Board of Agriculture, and also made available on the INSPIRE Geoportal. The Swedish agricultural blocks are vector data containing information on maximum eligible agricultural land according to EU definitions. The agricultural blocks are used by the Swedish Board of Agriculture to administer support to farmers, therefore the collection does not include all agricultural land in Sweden, but only the parts that a farmer has sought support for at some time.

A block is a polygon/surface that delimits an area of ​​agricultural land. A block is delimited by fixed boundaries. Examples of fixed boundaries are roads, stone walls, forests and buildings.

The dataset Agricultural blocks contains approximately 1,143,000 blocks. Of these, approximately 891,000 are arable land blocks and approximately 252,000 pasture land blocks. The total area is 3.2 million hectares, of which 2.7 million hectares are arable land and 510,000 hectares are pasture land. The average area for the arable land blocks is 3.03 ha and for the pasture blocks the corresponding figure is 2.03 ha.
